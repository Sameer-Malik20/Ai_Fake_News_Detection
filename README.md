# NewAppDetection - Fake News Detection Application

Live Link:https://melodic-stroopwafel-9e6e75.netlify.app

This project is a Fake News Detection web application that uses Machine Learning (ML) models to classify news articles as either *REAL* or *FAKE*. The application utilizes a Logistic Regression classifier and a TF-IDF vectorizer for text processing.

## Features

- **Fake News Classification**: Classify news articles as *REAL* or *FAKE*.
- **Web-based Interface**: Users can submit news articles through a web form, and the application will predict if the article is real or fake.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained using a dataset of news articles labeled as *REAL* or *FAKE*.
- **Easy Deployment**: Can be deployed on cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, etc.).

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: A React-based frontend to handle user interactions and display results.
- **Backend**: A Python backend to process news article predictions using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.x** - For backend development and model training
- **Node.js & npm** - For running the React frontend
- **Git** - Version control system

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NewAppDetection.git
cd NewAppDetection
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
python model.py
for trained model
python app.py run server
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Usage
Enter a news article into the input box.

Click the "Classify" button.

The application will predict if the news article is real or fake.

How the Model Works
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of news articles. The training process involves:

Text Preprocessing: Text is converted to a numerical representation using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Model: A logistic regression classifier is trained to predict if a given news article is REAL or FAKE.

Technologies Used
Frontend: ReactJS, HTML, CSS

Backend: Python, Flask/Django

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, TF-IDF)

Version Control: Git

Deployment: Heroku/AWS (optional)

Future Enhancements
Add more sophisticated ML models (e.g., Neural Networks) for better accuracy.

Implement a database (like MongoDB or MySQL) to store and manage user data.

Enable multi-language support for news articles.

Add real-time news fetching using APIs (e.g., NewsAPI) for automated predictions.
